## Install

- From pypi: `pip install pygecko`
- Local for development once cloned git repo: `poetry install`

## `geckolaunch.py` **Broken Currently**

`geckolaunch.py` allows you to launch a bunch of processes quickly using a launch
file. A launch file is just a simple json file where each line takes the form:
`[file, function, kwargs]`. Here is an example:

```bash
{
  "processes":
  [
    ["process", "publish", {"topic": "hello"}],
    ["process", "publish", {"topic": "hey there"}],
    ["process", "subscribe2", {"topic": "hello"}],
    ["process", "subscribe2", {"topic": "hello"}],
    ["process", "subscribe2", {"topic": "hey there"}],
    ["process", "subscribe2", {"topic": "hey there"}],
    ["process", "subscribe2", {"topic": "cv"}],
    ["process", "subscribe2", {"topic": "cv"}],
    ["process", "pcv", {"topic": "cv"}]
  ],
  "geckocore": {
      "host": "localhost"  # or hostname.local
  }
}
```

# Basic User API

## `geckopy`

See the examples, but this acts like a `rospy` and helps make writing
pub/sub or request/reply processes easy. See the `/examples` folder to
see it in action.

- **init_node():** this sets up the the process for communications with `geckocore`
- **is_shutdown():** returns `True` if node is signalled to exit
- **ok():** returns `True` if node is running
- **getLogger(name, file):** prints log messages to `stdout` or file
    ```python
    from pygecko import geckopy
    logger = geckopy.getLogger(__name__, "bob.txt")
    logger.info('this is a info message')  # just send a string
    logger.warning('this is a warning message')
    logger.error('this is a error message')
    logger.critical('this is a critical message')
    logger.debug('this is a debug message')
    ```
- **Rate(Hz):** given a frequency of how often a loop should run (i.e., 10Hz), the
returned object will dynamically set the sleep interval to achieve the rate. Ex:
    ```python
    from pygecko import geckopy
    rate = geckopy.Rate(20)  # run loop at 20 Hz
    while True:
        rate.sleep()
    ```
- **Publisher Helpers:** return a publisher object, or `None` on failure
    - pubBinderTCP(key, topic, queue_size=5)
    - pubBinderUDS(key, topic, queue_size=5)
    - pubConnectTCP(key, topic, queue_size=5)
    - pubConnectUDS(key, topic, queue_size=5)
- **Subscriber Helpers:** return a subscriber object, or `None` on failure
    - subBinderTCP(key, topic, queue_size=5)
    - subBinderUDS(key, topic, queue_size=5)
    - subConnectTCP(key, topic, queue_size=5)
    - subConnectUDS(key, topic, queue_size=5)
- **Request Helpers:** returns a request object, or `None` on failure
    - reqConnectTCP(key, topic, queue_size=5)
    - reqConnectUDS(key, topic, queue_size=5)
- **Reply Helpers:** return a reply object, or `None` on failure
    - repBinderTCP(key, topic, queue_size=5)
    - repBinderUDS(key, topic, queue_size=5)

## `zmq`

Generally you will use the `geckopy` helpers to get pub/sub. However, if you
already know the address and don't need core, you can create one directly. This
is most useful for testing.

- **Subscriber:** creates a subscriber and returns it
    - Sub.connect(self, addr, hwm=None, queue_size=10)
    - Sub.bind(self, addr, hwm=None, queue_size=10, random=False)
- **Publisher:** creates a publisher and returns it
    - Pub.connect(self, addr, hwm=None, queue_size=10)
    - Pub.bind(self, addr, hwm=None, queue_size=10, random=False)
